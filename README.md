# TensorFlow_Tutorials

A collection of Jupyter notebooks containing my work mirroring TensorFlow tutorials available at https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials. Projects are separated by the task they set out to perform on the dataset and the dataset used. For space reasons models aren't included in the repository.
